### Summary

> Neurons use two main schemes to encode information: rate coding (frequency of
> firing) and temporal coding (timing or pattern of firing). While the importance
> of rate coding is well established, it remains controversial whether temporal
> codes alone are sufficient for controlling behavior. Moreover, the molecular
> mechanisms underlying the generation of specific temporal codes are enigmatic.
> Here, we show in Drosophila clock neurons that distinct temporal spike patterns,
> dissociated from changes in firing rate, encode time-dependent arousal and
> regulate sleep. From a large-scale genetic screen, we identify the molecular
> pathways mediating the circadian-dependent changes in ionic flux and spike
> morphology that rhythmically modulate spike timing. Remarkably, the daytime
> spiking pattern alone is sufficient to drive plasticity in downstream arousal
> neurons, leading to increased firing of these cells. These findings demonstrate
> a causal role for temporal coding in behavior and define a form of synaptic
> plasticity triggered solely by temporal spike patterns.

## Directories

The following directories are added to the parent project directory. They
should be mostly self-explanatory. The main code library is in the `flymodel`
subdirectory.
